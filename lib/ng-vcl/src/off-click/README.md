# offClick directive

The offClick event fires when a click event is handled and its source is not(!) the element or any of its subelements.

## Usage

```typescript
import { VCLOffClickModule } from '@vcl/ng-vcl';

@NgModule({
  imports: [ VCLOffClickModule ],
  ...
})
export class AppComponent {}
```

offClick() is called when the click`s source is not DIV1 or DIV2

```html
<div (offClick)="offClick()">
  DIV1
  <div>DIV2</div>
</div>
```
