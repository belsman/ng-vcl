# vcl-drawer

Sliding drawer with content area. In closed state, only the content area is visible.

## Usage

```html
<vcl-drawer-container>
  <vcl-drawer mode="side"> Drawer </vcl-drawer>
  Content
</vcl-drawer-container>
```

### Drawer modes

`side`: Drawer appears besides the content. The content is pushed away and shrinked to make space for the drawer.
`over`: Drawer floats over the content. The content is covered by a backdrop.

### Opening and closing the drawer

A drawer can be opened and closed with the `opened` property.

The opened state can also be changed via the drawer instance.
It exposes a `open()`, `close()` and `toggle()` method.

```html
<vcl-drawer-container #drawer="vclDrawer">
  <vcl-drawer>...</vcl-drawer>
  ...
</vcl-drawer-container>
<button (click)="drawer.toggle()">Toggle</button>
```
